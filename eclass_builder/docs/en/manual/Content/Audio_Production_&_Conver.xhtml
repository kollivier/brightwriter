    <h1 align="center">Audio Production &amp; Conversion</h1><div>Audio production and conversion is these days a fairly simple process. Most of the tasks can be completed with a single audio editing tool, such as <a href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">Audacity</a>, a popular free and open source program, or any number of other commercial audio editing programs.Â </div><div><br /></div><div>The important things to remember when exporting your audio into your EClass is that it must be saved in the MP3 format. If you are using Audacity, you will need to install a library to enable this feature. You can find instructions on how to do so <a href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/help/faq?s=install&amp;i=lame-mp3" target="_blank">on this page</a>. Once you have done that (or if you are using a program with built-in MP3 export), all you will need to record audio is a microphone, or a cable to plug your audio device into the line-in port on your computer. After that, just record your audio, export it to MP3, and you will be able to embed it in your EClass!</div>
