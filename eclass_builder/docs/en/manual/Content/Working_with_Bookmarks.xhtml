    <h1 align="center">Working with Bookmarks</h1><div>Bookmarks are a way of linking to various sections of your EClass page, and are often used to do things such as adding a bibliography to your EClass page. </div><div><br /></div><div>To add a bookmark involves two steps. The first step is to create the bookmark. To do this, you click right before the text you want to add a bookmark to, and select "Bookmark" from the "Insert" menu. Then you type a name for your bookmark.</div><div><br /></div><div>Once you've created the bookmark, the next step is to create a link that goes to it. To do this, select the text you wish to link to the bookmark (in the case of a bibliography, it might be a footnote reference like [1]), then click on the <img src="images/world_link.png" /> button on the toolbar, or select "Hyperlink" from the "Insert" menu. Then type a # symbol followed by the name of your bookmark. For example, if your bookmark is named "footnote1", you would type "#footnote1" as the name of your bookmark, without the quotes. That is all there is to it!</div>
