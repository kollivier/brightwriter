learn EClass.Builder, it may be easy to think of it as a visual 'book
building' software package. Creating an EClass involves the following
steps: <br>
<ul>
  <li>Creating a new project</li>
  <li>Creating a series of pages and organizing them (i.e. into the chapters, sections and sub-sections of a book)<br>
  </li>
  <li>Publishing the EClass to CD-ROM or the Internet so your audience can view it.</li>
</ul>
It is important to remember, however, that EClass is not just about
text - pages can contain interactive elements, like quizzes, or
multimedia elements, like graphics, presentations or even audio and
video. When building an EClass, be sure to take advantage of these
capabilities at every opportunity - research has shown that a
picture truly is worth a thousand words to your audience. The next few
sections will help you get started. <br>
