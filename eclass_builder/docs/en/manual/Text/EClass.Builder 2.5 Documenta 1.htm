EClass.Builder is a 
full-featured software package for developing learning modules, web
sites, and other forms of hypertext documentation. It runs on Windows,
Linux and Mac OS X, and documentation built using EClass.Builder can be
deployed on the Internet or CD-ROM. <br>

What's New?</b></font><br>
<br>
The major new features of version 2.5 are: <br>
<ul>
  <li><b>New Plug-In System: </b>EClass.Builder 2.5 now allows
third-party developers to write support for new content formats. Now,
when you create a new page, you can select what kind of content you
want to create - an EClass page, a quiz or even a web page. Also, new
content formats can often be downloaded and installed without having to
update your entire EClass.Builder installation. <br>
  </li>
  <li><b>Visual HTML Editing: </b>With the new 'web page' page type, you can now edit web pages as easily as if you were writing a
document in your favorite word processor. This format offers you more
control over your content, allowing you to make links or insert images
and other media anywhere in the page without restriction. You can also
use copy and paste to insert content from other documents or web sites.</li>
  <li><b>Integrated Search Engine:</b> EClass.Builder now comes out of
the box with support for creating a full-text index of all the content
in your EClass. Contents can be searched via CD, and soon via the
Internet as well.<br>
  </li>
  <li><b>Quiz Page Type: </b>Quickly and easily generate self-grading
quizzes to help learners test their comprehension. You can also provide
feedback for both correct and incorrect responses. <br>
  </li>
  <li><b>Themes:</b> EClass has traditionally given little control over
the look and feel of the course. EClass.Builder 2.5 introduces themes,
which allow you to change the look and feel of your course and even
create your own themes. Advanced users can even write 'macros' (in Python) to
extend the functionality of their EClass.</li>
  <li><b>Foreign Language Support:</b> The EClass.Builder interface has
been translated into Spanish and other languages can be added via an
XML-based translation system.<br>
</li>
</ul></body></html>
