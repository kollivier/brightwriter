<div align="left">You can use the Theme Manager to create, remove, and
share EClass themes. (The ability to edit themes from within
EClass.Builder is planned for a future release.)  Themes are stored in the "themes" subdirectory of your EClass.<br>
<br>
<b>Creating a New Theme<br>
<br>
</b>To create a new theme, simply click the "+" button and type in a
name for your new theme. The new theme will be based upon the "Default
(No Frames)" EClass theme. <br>
<br>
<b>Copying a Theme</b><br>
<br>
If you want to modify an existing theme, you can use the Copy button
(two papers) to  make a copy of an existing theme. Simply select the
theme you wish to copy, and click on the Copy button, then type a name
for your new theme.<br>
<br>
<b>Removing a Theme</b><br>
<br>
You can remove a theme by selecting the "-" button. Please make sure
you don't have any EClasses that depend on the theme before removing
it, as it will permanently remove the theme.<br>
<br>

<br>
You can Import and Export EClass themes, so that people can develop their own and share them with others. <br>
<br>

folder and filename to save your theme to. You can then send this files
to others and share it however you like.<br>
<br>
To Import a theme, click on the "Import Theme" button and select the theme file you wish to import. That's it. =)<br>

software.)<br>
<br>
</i><b>Editing Themes<br>
