<div align="left">Before we start getting into the technical "how to do
things" with EClass, I'd like to start by discussing some of the core
concepts behind the EClass.Builder program. First we'll need to look at
how we see the EClass creation process (really the process for creating
documentation or learning modules).<br>
<br>

<br>



<b><font size="4">The Creation Process</font><br>
<br>
</b>Whether you are creating a learning module, some form of online
documentation, or a web site, the process is very similar. This is why
EClass is well-suited for creating all these types of products. In any project, we all
perform the following four steps, though some people may perform the
steps without even realizing they are doing it!<br>



<ol>



  <li><b>Design: </b>Define the target audience and their needs,
delivery medium (i.e. web site, CD-ROM, etc.), and determine what the
product needs. For larger projects, this may include performing surveys
and other pre-assessments.<br>
  </li>
  <li><b>Build: </b>Gather and create content, organize and structure
presentation of content, obtain any ncessary copyright permissions,
conduct internal testing and reviews.</li>
  <li><b>Deploy:</b> Distribute the content, collect feedback, and
provide any additional services (i.e. training sessions, walkthroughs)
that go with the product.</li>
  <li><b>Evaluate: </b>Review target audience feedback, review the entire process, define improvements to be made.<br>
</li>
</ol>


There is actually a fifth step as well: <b>Repeat!</b> Do it all over again next time (only better). Notice that these steps are not necessarily
linear, and the pie shown above reflects that. The center of the "pie"
is your EClass, and the tasks outlined above are constantly taking
place to make your EClass a better product. <br>



<ol>




  
</ol>




The eventual goal of the EClass toolkit is to provide a set of tools
for each step in this process, although our current product,
EClass.Builder, focuses on steps #2-3. So how does EClass help authors
with these steps?<br>



<br>



<b>Building an EClass</b><br>



<ul>



  <li><b>Simple interface and small learning curve: </b>EClass.Builder
knows a lot about the technical issues involved in making an EClass
work so that you don't have to. For example, when you add a file to
your EClass, EClass.Builder
automatically copies the file into your EClass for you. It also
automatically generates the table of contents, and creates "back and
next" links on each page for you. The new Link Checker helps ensure
that you don't publish an EClass with broken web links either. The
result of this is no "broken
links" when you publish your EClass to web or CD. That lets you focus
on creating the content, not figuring out where to put your files or
how to make it work.</li><li><b>Accepts many content formats: </b>EClass lets you insert Word
Documents, PDFs, PowerPoints, Flash, Windows Media, and other
multimedia formats into your EClass. (Though the end user may need a
viewer installed on their computer.) This way authors can spend less
time trying to get files into the right format, and can use content
they've already created as easy as point and click.</li>
  <li><b>Easy organization of content: </b>Working in
EClass.Builder, you can move, restructure, copy and paste pages
wherever you want them to go. This makes it quick and easy to move
content around if the structure changes.</li>
  <li><b>Themes: </b>Every page has a consistent design, sometimes also
called a "Theme", associated with it. This ensures your users do not
get confused or lost while navigating your EClass. You can pick a theme
from the list of available themes using the Theme Manager, or if you
know some HTML, you can create your own. You could also download new
themes created by others. <br>
  </li>
  <li><b>Cross-browser Preview:</b> See how the pages of your EClass
will look in Internet Explorer, Netscape and Mozilla (Windows only for
IE) and discover potential display problems before the user does. <br>
  </li>
  <li><b>Support custom content-formats: </b>Advanced authors or
organizations can create their own plugins to support special content
formats, such as a quiz or EClass Page. This helps organization link
legacy data formats (or special data formats) into an EClass.</li>
</ul>



<b>Deploying an EClass</b><br>



<ul>



  <li><b>FTP Publishing:</b> When you want to put your EClass up on the
web, just type in your web server, name, password and the directory
you'd like to put your EClass, and EClass will do the rest.</li>
  <li><b>CD Publishing:</b> EClass.Builder prepares your EClass for
CD-ROM delivery by creating an autostart file (for Windows) and making
sure every file you need is included within your EClass. Just copy all
the files inside your EClass folder to your CD burner software and burn
your EClass!</li>
</ul>



Now that we've looked at what EClass.Builder can do to help you, let's
look at how EClass.Builder can be used to create your EClass!<br>
