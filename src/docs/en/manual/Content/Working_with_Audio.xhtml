    <h1 align="center">Working with Audio</h1><div>BrightWriter supports embedding audio files in the MP3 audio format into your EClass. This format was chosen because it offers the broadest support among the various devices and software that people may use to view your EClass. For information on how to get your audio into MP3 format, please refer to the "Multimedia Overview" section.</div><div><br /></div><div>To insert audio into your EClass page, select "Audio" from the "Insert" menu. This will bring up the "Audio Properties" dialog.</div><div><br /></div><div style="text-align: center;"><img src="images/audio properties.png" />Â </div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;">To insert your audio file, either type in the URL to the audio file (if it is located on a server), or click "Browse" to select the file on your hard drive. The file will be copied into your EClass if it is not already located there. Click "OK" to insert the audio. Note that you may not be able to directly see or play the audio at this point, this is an issue that is being worked on and that we hope to finish in a future version.</div>
