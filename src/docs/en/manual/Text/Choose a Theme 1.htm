 Now that you've created a new project, you'll want to define how it
will look to your end users. You can do this using the theme manager. To
access the theme manager, from the EClass main menu, select
"Tools-&gt;Theme Manager". Click on a theme in the left-hand side list
to preview how it will look, then click the "Use this theme" button to
apply it to your EClass. Click OK when you are finished making changes.
You can change the theme at any time.<br>

<br>

Note that the buttons on the bottom-left hand corner are for adding,
removing and copying themes. You can also import and export themes. More about these options are covered in
the "Advanced Options" section of the documentation.<br>
