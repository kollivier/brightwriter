  <br />
  <ul>
   <li>
    Creating a new project
   </li>
   <li>
    Creating a series of pages and organizing them (i.e. into the
chapters, sections and sub-sections of a book)
    <br />
   </li>
   <li>
    Publishing the EClass so your audience can view it</li>
  </ul>
  It is important to remember, however, that EClasses are not just about
text - pages can contain multimedia elements, like graphics, presentations or even audio and
video. The next
few sections will help you get started.
