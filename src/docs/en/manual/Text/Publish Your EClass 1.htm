  Once you have finished creating and organizing your EClass, it is
time to publish it. To publish your EClass, you will need to have
access to either a CD-Recordable/Rewritable drive (for CD
publishing), or have a web site you can post the EClass to (for
Internet publishing). We will cover the steps for both methods
below.
  <br />
  <br />
  <b>
   Publishing to CD / DVD </b><br />
  From the main screen, either click on the <img src="images/cd_go.png" /> button in the toolbar, or select
  <i>
   File-&gt;Publish-&gt;To CD / DVD </i>from the main menu. BrightWriter will now update the full-text index (if you enabled
searching) and prepare your EClass for CD / DVD publishing. When that
is finished, a folder will appear with all the files that need to
be burned to CD / DVD. You will need to either copy and paste, or
drag and drop, the files into your CD recording software.
  <br />
  <br />
  <b>
   Publishing to Internet/FTP
   <br />
   <br />
  </b>
  From the main screen, either click on the <img src="images/server_go.png" /> button, or select
  <i>
   File-&gt;Publish-&gt;To Web Site
  </i>
  from the main menu. A
dialog will appear asking for some information.
  <br />
  <br />
  <div class="c2">
   <img src="../Graphics/publish_web_site.jpg" />
   <br />
   <br />
   <div class="c1">
    Often, most of this information will be given to
you by either your network system administrator, or your internet
service provider. The
    <b>
     Host
    </b>
    is the name of the web site you
would like to post your EClass to,
    <b>
     Username
    </b>
    and
    <b>
     Password
    </b>
    are your user account information, and
    <b>
     Directory
    </b>
    is the folder on the web site where you want your
EClass to reside.
    <br />
    <br />
    The
    <b>
     Passive FTP
    </b>
    option is sometimes necessary to enable
uploading to some internet service providers. If you are
experiencing problems uploading, try selecting the Passive FTP
option and trying again.
    <br />
    <br />
    The dialog will show upload progress for each individual file as
well as for the entire upload process as a whole. Note that this
may take some time on slow internet connections.
