<br> The EClass Page Editor lets you specify both text and multimedia
data for your page. It takes care of all the "magic" required to embed
those media files into a web page. It also stores information on the
objectives of the page (learning goals and objectives, etc.) and lets
you link to more information using Hotwords. <br>
<br>
Adding files to your EClass Page is simple. Just click on the <img src="../Graphics/OPEN.gif">
button, select the file to add, and click the "Open" button. Note that
you can only add one media file of each type per page - further inserts
will override the old value.<br>
<br>
The text media type is special - you can create and edit texts using
the buttons below the Text selection box. Clicking on "New" will allow
you to create a new text file and save it. Clicking on Edit will, if
you have configured BrightWriter to use a default HTML editor, open
the Text page in that HTML editor application.<br>
<br>
It also lets you create <b>Hotwords</b>, which can be EClass Pages
themselves or links to a file or web site, which link to more
information about a particular term found in the page. The word you used as your Hotword <b>must</b> be in the text of the page for the hotword to work. <br>
<br>
To add, remove,
or edit hotwords or objectives, just click on the "Add", "Edit" and
"Remove" buttons below the Hotwords and Objectives listboxes. <br>
