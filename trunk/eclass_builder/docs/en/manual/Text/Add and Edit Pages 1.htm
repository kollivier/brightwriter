  In eBook Builder, everything is a "page". A PDF file you inserted,
for example, would be considered a page in your eBook. So in order
to add content to your eBook, you must create pages. Pages have
the following elements:
  <br />
  <ul>
   <li>
    <b>
     Page File:
    </b>
    The content of each eBook page comes from a
file on disk. Each eBook page must have a file associated with
it.  </li>
   <li>
    <b>
     Page Properties:
    </b>
    eBook Builder lets you specify properties of pages in your eBook, including name, keywords, description, among other
things. </li>
  </ul>
  There are two primary ways to add a page to your eBook - you can
create a new page, or import a file.
  <br />
  <br />
  <b>
   Create a New Page
  </b>
  <br />
  To create a new page, you must first select the page you want as
its parent. Then, click the
  <img src="../Graphics/new16.gif" />
  button to create a new page. (You can also right-click, or click
the Page menu, and select "Add New".) You will now see the
following screen:
  <br />
  <br />
  <img src="../Graphics/newpage.jpg" />
  <br />
  <br />
  Type in a name for your new page, then click OK to create the page.  <br />
  <br />
  <b>
   Import a File</b><br />
  <br />
  The other way to add a new page to your eBook is to import a file.
To do this, select the page you want as the new page's parent, then
right-click (or select Page from the main menu) and select "Import
File...". The following screen will appear:
  <br />
  <br />
  <img src="../Graphics/importfile.jpg" />
  <br />
  <br />
  Type in a name and select the?
  <img src="../Graphics/OPEN.gif" />
  button next to the "Page Content" field. Select the file you want
to insert, and click the "Open" button. Click OK to save your
changes.
