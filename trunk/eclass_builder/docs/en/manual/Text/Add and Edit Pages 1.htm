<html><head><base href="about:blank"></head><body>In EClass.Builder,
everything is a "page". A PDF file you inserted, for example, would be
considered a page in your EClass. So in order to add content to your
EClass, you must create pages. Pages have the following elements:<br>


<ul>


  <li><b>Page File:</b> The content of each EClass page comes from a file on disk. Each EClass page must have a file associated with it.<br>
  </li>
  <li><b>Page Type: </b>Each EClass page has a type, which is
determined by the file it contains. For example, if the page contains
an ".html" file, it's type is a "web page". If it contains a ".quiz"
file, it's type is a "quiz". EClass understands some types, but not
others, and for types it does not internally understand (i.e. PDF) it
simply defers to the operating system for how to handle the file.<br>
  </li>
  <li><b>Page Properties: </b>EClass lets you specify properties of a file, including name, keywords, description, among other things. <br>
  </li>
  <li><b>Page Structure:</b> Each page knows where it is located in an
EClass, and it also knows about the page(s) around it.? In short, each
page has its place in the hierarchy of the course. The page one level
above the current page is referred to as its "parent", and any pages
one level below the current page are referred to as its "children".
Any pages <b>on the same level</b> but before or after the current page are referred to as its "siblings".<b> </b><br>
  </li>
</ul>

There are two primary ways to add a page to your EClass - you can create a new page, or import a file.<br>


<br>


<b>Create a New Page</b><br>


To create a new page, you must first select the page you want as its parent. Then, click the <img src="../Graphics/new16.gif">
button to create a new page. (You can also right-click, or click the
Page menu, and select "Add New".) You will now see the following
screen: <br>


<br>

<br>


Type in a name for your new page, and then determine which type of page
you want EClass to create. You can currently create an EClass Page (the
default), a web page, or a quiz. Try creating pages of each type and
see what happens.<br>


<br>


<b>Import a File</b><br>


<br>


The other way to add a new page to your EClass is to import a file. To
do this, select the page you want as the new page's parent, then
right-click (or select Page from the main menu) and select "Import
File...". The following screen will appear:<br>


<br>


<img src="../Graphics/importfile.jpg"><br>


<br>


Type in a name and select the?<img src="../Graphics/OPEN.gif">
button next to the "Page Content" field. Select the file you want to
insert, and click the "Open" button. Click OK to save your changes.<br>


<br>


Double-clicking on the page in your EClass treeview will enable you to
edit it. Since each page type has a different editor, in the next
sections we will look at editing each page type individually.<br>
