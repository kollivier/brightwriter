languages. This process is commonly referred to as 'localization', to
distinguish it from 'translation' which generally refers to translating
program documentation or the content of an eBook. In order for eBook Builder to support a new
language, all that needs to be done is to develop a localization file
(named eclass.po).
All of eBook's localization files are stored in the &lt;eBook Program
Folder&gt;\locale subdirectory. <br>

<br>

Inside that directory, each language gets its own folder, which
contains a LC_MESSAGES subfolder, and finally the eBook Builder localization file for that language. For example, here are the contents
of the current eBook Builder locale directory, which contains
translations for English, Spanish, and French:<br>

<br>

locale\en\LC_MESSAGES\eclass.po<br>

locale\en\LC_MESSAGES\eclass.mo<br>

<br>

locale\es\LC_MESSAGES\eclass.po<br>

locale\es\LC_MESSAGES\eclass.mo<br>

<br>

locale\fr\LC_MESSAGES\eclass.po<br>

locale\fr\LC_MESSAGES\eclass.mo<br>

<br>

en, es, and fr are the two letter codes for English, Spanish and
French, respectively. To lookup the two letter code for your own
language, you can go to: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/IG/ert/iso639.htm">http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/IG/ert/iso639.htm</a>.
<br>
<br>
If you create a new language, make sure to create a subdirectory of
locale that uses the two letter code for your language. This is
necessary because Windows, Mac, and Linux refer to languages by these
codes, so eBook can actually check which language the system is
running and use the correct localization file without asking the user
which language s/he wants to use.<br>

<br>

What are the eclass.mo and eclass.po files? The eclass.po file is the
localization file containing all the text entries that need to be
localized. The eclass.mo file is a binary index file. It is created to
speed up the loading of text, similar in nature to how databases enable
you to search large amounts of text quickly. People wishing to localize eBook Builder need only worry about the .po files. Once you send me
the finished eclass.po file for a particular language, I will
automatically generate the appropriate binary file needed by eBook Builder.<br>

<br>

<b>Creating a New Language</b> <b>File</b><br>

<br>
If you are creating a new localization file for eBook Builder, you
should start by copying the English language eclass.po file to the new
subdirectory for your language.<br>

<br>
&nbsp;<b>Localizing the Text<br>
<br>
</b>Open the &lt;eBook
Directory&gt;\locale\&lt;Your Language Code&gt;\LC_MESSAGES\eclass.po
file for editing. It is a plain text file. If you're not familiar
with editing .po files, I would <b>highly recommend </b>using <a target="_blank" href="http://poedit.sourceforge.net/">poEdit</a> to edit the
file, as
it has a number of helpful features such as Unicode support and putting
untranslated entries at the top of the list. In poEdit, just open the eclass.po file, select an English item from
the list, and type the translation in the bottom left-hand box, below
the English text box. Do not type over the English text - eBook uses
the English text in order to 'look up' the localized text.<br>

<br>

<b>Submitting the Translation File</b> <br>
<br>
When you're done creating a new translation or editing an existing one,
please send a note to the eclass-users mailing list and I will tell you
where to send the file. Thanks! =)<br>
