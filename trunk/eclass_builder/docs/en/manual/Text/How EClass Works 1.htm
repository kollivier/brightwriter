   Before we start getting into the technical "how to
do things" with EClass.Builder, I'd like to start by discussing some of the
core concepts behind the EClass.Builder program. First we'll need
to look at how we see the EClass creation process (really the
process for creating documentation or learning modules).
   <br />

    The Creation Process
   </span>
   <br />
   <br />
  </b>
  Whether you are creating a learning module, some form of
online documentation, or a web site, the process is very similar.
This is why EClass.Builder is well-suited for creating all these types of
products. In any project, we all perform the following four steps,
though some people may perform the steps without even realizing
they are doing it!
  <br />
  <ol>
   <li>
    <b>
     Design:
    </b>
    Define the target audience and their needs,
delivery medium (i.e. web site, CD-ROM, etc.), and determine what
the product needs. For larger projects, this may include performing
surveys and other pre-assessments.
    <br />
   </li>
   <li>
    <b>
     Build:
    </b>
    Gather and create content, organize and structure
presentation of content, obtain any ncessary copyright permissions,
conduct internal testing and reviews.
   </li>
   <li>
    <b>
     Deploy:
    </b>
    Distribute the content, collect feedback, and
provide any additional services (i.e. training sessions,
walkthroughs) that go with the product.
   </li>
   <li>
    <b>
     Evaluate:
    </b>
    Review target audience feedback, review the
entire process, define improvements to be made.
    <br />
   </li>
  </ol>
  There is actually a fifth step as well:
  <b>
   Repeat!
  </b>
  Do it all
over again next time (only better). Notice that these steps are not
necessarily linear, and the pie shown above reflects that. The
center of the "pie" is your EClass, and the tasks outlined above
are constantly taking place to make your EClass a better
product.
<br />
  <br />
  <b>
   Building an EClass
  </b>
  <br />
  <ul>
   <li>
    <b>
     Simple interface and small learning curve: </b>EClass.Builder knows a lot about the technical issues involved in
making an EClass work so that you don't have to. For example, when
you add a file to your EClass, EClass.Builder automatically copies
the file into your EClass for you. It also supports conversion to many popular formats so that you can reach as broad an audience as possible. These, among other features, let you focus on creating the content, not figuring out where
to put your files or how to make it work.
   </li>
   <li>
    <b>
     Accepts many content formats:
    </b>
    EClass lets you insert
Word Documents, PDFs, PowerPoints, Flash, Windows Media, QuickTime and other
multimedia formats into your EClass. (Though the end user may need
a viewer installed on their computer.) This way authors can spend
less time trying to get files into the right format, and can use
content they've already created as easy as point and click.
   </li>
   <li>
    <b>
     Easy organization of content:
    </b>
    Working in EClass.Builder,
you can move, restructure, copy and paste pages wherever you want
them to go. This makes it quick and easy to move content around if
the structure changes.</li>
  </ul>
  <b>
   Deploying an EClass
  </b>
  <br />
  <ul>
   <li><b>ePub Export: </b>Export your content to any ePub compatible device, including the Apple iPad, Sony e-Reader, Barnes &amp; Noble Nook, etc. </li><li><b>IMS Content Package Export: </b>Export your content to various IMS and SCORM-compliant Learning Management Systems such as Moodle.</li><li>
    <b>
     FTP Publishing:
    </b>
    When you want to put your EClass up on
the web, just type in your web server, name, password and the
directory you'd like to put your EClass, and EClass will do the
rest.
   </li>
   <li>
    <b>
     CD Publishing: </b>EClass.Builder prepares your EClass for
CD-ROM delivery by creating an autostart file (for Windows) and
making sure every file you need is included within your EClass.
Just copy all the files inside your EClass folder to your CD burner
software and burn your EClass!</li>
  </ul>
  Now that we've looked at what EClass.Builder can do to help you,
let's look at how EClass.Builder can be used to create your
EClass!
