   Before we start getting into the technical "how to
do things" with eBook Builder, I'd like to start by discussing some of the
core concepts behind the eBook Builder program. First we'll need
to look at how we see the eBook creation process (really the
process for creating documentation or learning modules).

    The Creation Process
   </span>
   <br />
   <br />
  </b>
  Whether you are creating a learning module, some form of
online documentation, or a web site, the process is very similar.
This is why eBook Builder is well-suited for creating all these types of
products. In any project, we all perform the following four steps,
though some people may perform the steps without even realizing
they are doing it!
  <br />
  <ol>
   <li>
    <b>
     Design:
    </b>
    Define the target audience and their needs,
delivery medium (i.e. web site, CD-ROM, etc.), and determine what
the product needs. For larger projects, this may include performing
surveys and other pre-assessments.
    <br />
   </li>
   <li>
    <b>
     Build:
    </b>
    Gather and create content, organize and structure
presentation of content, obtain any ncessary copyright permissions,
conduct internal testing and reviews.
   </li>
   <li>
    <b>
     Deploy:
    </b>
    Distribute the content, collect feedback, and
provide any additional services (i.e. training sessions,
walkthroughs) that go with the product.
   </li>
   <li>
    <b>
     Evaluate:
    </b>
    Review target audience feedback, review the
entire process, define improvements to be made.
    <br />
   </li>
  </ol>
  There is actually a fifth step as well:
  <b>
   Repeat!
  </b>
  Do it all
over again next time (only better). Notice that these steps are not
necessarily linear, and the pie shown above reflects that. The
center of the "pie" is your eBook, and the tasks outlined above
are constantly taking place to make your eBook a better
product.

   Building an eBook
  </b>
  <br />
  <ul>
   <li>
    <b>
     Simple interface and small learning curve: eBook Builder</b> knows a lot about the technical issues involved in
making an eBook work so that you don't have to. For example, when
you add a file to your eBook, eBook Builder automatically copies
the file into your eBook for you. It also automatically generates
the table of contents for whatever formats you wish to export to. These, among other features, let you focus on creating the content, not figuring out where
to put your files or how to make it work.
   </li>
   <li>
    <b>
     Accepts many content formats:
    </b>
    eBook lets you insert
Word Documents, PDFs, PowerPoints, Flash, Windows Media, and other
multimedia formats into your eBook. (Though the end user may need
a viewer installed on their computer.) This way authors can spend
less time trying to get files into the right format, and can use
content they've already created as easy as point and click.
   </li>
   <li>
    <b>
     Easy organization of content:
    </b>
    Working in eBook Builder,
you can move, restructure, copy and paste pages wherever you want
them to go. This makes it quick and easy to move content around if
the structure changes.</li>
  </ul>
  <b>
   Deploying an eBook
  </b>
  <br />
  <ul>
   <li><b>ePub Export: </b>Export your content to any ePub compatible device, including the Apple iPad, Sony e-Reader, Barnes &amp; Noble Nook, etc. </li><li><b>IMS Content Package Export: </b>Export your content to various IMS and SCORM-compliant Learning Management Systems such as Moodle.</li><li>
    <b>
     FTP Publishing:
    </b>
    When you want to put your eBook up on
the web, just type in your web server, name, password and the
directory you'd like to put your eBook, and eBook will do the
rest.
   </li>
   <li>
    <b>
     CD Publishing: eBook Builder</b> prepares your eBook for
CD-ROM delivery by creating an autostart file (for Windows) and
making sure every file you need is included within your eBook.
Just copy all the files inside your eBook folder to your CD burner
software and burn your eBook!</li>
  </ul>
  Now that we've looked at what eBook Builder can do to help you,
let's look at how eBook Builder can be used to create your
eBook!
