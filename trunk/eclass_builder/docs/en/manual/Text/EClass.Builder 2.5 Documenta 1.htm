  <br />EClass.Builder is a full-featured software package for developing
EClasss, learning modules, and other forms of electronic
documentation. The aim of this program is to reduce the technology
learning curve associated with creating online educational content.
It runs on Windows, Linux and Mac OS X, and documentation built
using EClass.Builder can be deployed to eBook readers with ePub support, Learning
Management Systems, the Internet or CD-ROM.<br />

    What's New?
   </b>
  </span>
  <br />
  <br />
  The major new features of version 3.0 are:
  <ul>
   <li>
    <b>
     Inline Page Editing:
    </b>
    Instead of converting documents
from MS Word or other formats to HTML and importing them to EClass,
now you can just create a new document and start typing! You can
also copy and paste text and other content from almost any other
program.'</li><li><b>HTML "Clean Up" Support:</b> Standards like ePub require the XHTML content to comply with strict open standards. Programs like Microsoft Word are notorious for exporting non-standard HTML which will not be readable by ePub viewers or some other programs. So now EClass has a feature to automatically convert this HTML to standards-compliant XHTML, and generates it by default when you edit.</li>
   <li>
    <b>
     ePub Standards Support:
    </b>
    Export your EClass to a
standards compliant format viewable by almost all eBook readers.
   </li><li><b>IMS Package import / export: </b>Export and distribute your EClass project as an IMS Content Package ZIP file. Or import IMS Content Package files from other sources, such as MIT OpenCourseWare. </li><li><b>Less Clutter:</b> In previous versions, EClass would put CD and web export files into the project directory. Now, you specify an export directory and any files added to the project are placed there. That way, you're not uploading CD files to the web, or including them in your ePub / IMS export.</li><li><b>Improved Unicode Support:</b> There have been numerous fixes ensuring that an EClass created in one language can be viewed and edited on other computers, even those which may be set to another language. </li>
  </ul>
