<html><head><base href="about:blank"></head><body>EClass.Builder is written entirely in the <a href="http://www.python.org" target="_blank">Python</a> programming language. Here's a high-level overview of the components of the system.<br>


<br>

<b>How EClass Works</b><br>

<br>

EClass.Builder is similar to a content management program in nature,
although geared towards documentation and e-learning. It seeks to
enable the user to accomplish three main tasks:<br>

<ul>

  <li>Import documentation data from many disparate locations and content formats</li>
  <li>Edit and manage data via an easy-to-use interface</li>
  <li>Publish the documentation in several popular formats</li>
</ul>

In short, allow users to work with disparate data formats
transparently, while still achieving a consistent and clean final
product. The only way to achieve this goal is to make EClass.Builder <b>extensible</b>.
At every major level you can 'plug-in' to the system to support your
own input and output formats. Here is how EClass.Builder can be
extended by third-party developers:<br>

<ul>

  <li><b>Plugins</b> allow you to add support for importing and editing
new and custom data formats. (Currently, the appropriate plugin for a
data file is chosen by file extension.) A plugin contains the Python
data objects, the wxPython-based content editor, and the HTMLPublisher
that a plugin needs to interoperate with EClass.Builder.<br>
  </li>
  <li><b>Themes</b> allow you to change the look and feel of the HTML
version of your EClass, and even lets you edit the publishing process (via the themes/&lt;theme_name&gt;.py file)
to enable new functionality (i.e. breadcrumbs, navigation bars, etc.)</li>
  <li><b>Publishers</b> manage the process of publishing an EClass to a
particular format. Currently HTML and PDF publishers exist, but more
can be created. (Note that the API for making Publishers "plug-in" to
EClass isn't totally finished yet but is being worked on.)<br>
  </li>
</ul>

For the most part, you can extend EClass.Builder without having to get
into the guts of the program, and you can share your extensions with
others as well. This makes for an interesting situation whereby the
core EClass.Builder program need not grow considerably in complexity -
users and developers simply "plug-in" the extra features they need to
get their work done.<br>
