  <br />
  <ul>
   <li>
    Creating a new project
   </li>
   <li>
    Creating a series of pages and organizing them (i.e. into the
chapters, sections and sub-sections of a book)
    <br />
   </li>
   <li>
    Publishing the eBook so your audience can view it</li>
  </ul>
  It is important to remember, however, that eBooks are not just about
text - pages can contain interactive elements, like quizzes, or
multimedia elements, like graphics, presentations or even audio and
video. When building an eBook, be sure to take advantage of these
capabilities at every opportunity - research has shown that a
picture truly is worth a thousand words to your audience. The next
few sections will help you get started.
