    <h1 align="center">Working with Video</h1><div>EClass.Builder supports the embedding of video into your EClass in the MP4 and/or OGG video formats. These video formats were chosen because they have the broadest support of devices and software that are able to play the format. For more information on how to get your video into the MP4 and OGG video format, please see the "Multimedia Overview" section.</div><div><br /></div><div>To insert a video into your EClass page, select "Video" from the "Insert" menu. This will bring up the "Video Properties" dialog.</div><div><br /></div><div style="text-align: center;"><img src="images/video properties.png" /><br /></div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;">Hopefully future versions of EClass.Builder will be able to simplify this process, but currently there are basically two approaches for embedding video. One is to only embed MP4, and rely on the Free JW Player to properly determine whether to play the video directly or using Flash, or use HTML5 video support and encode the video in both MP4 and OGG video formats (as Firefox and future versions of Google Chrome will not play MP4 video). </div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;">If you are developing an EClass that is free and not for commercial purposes, we recommend you use the JW Player. In this case, all you need to specify are an MP4 video and a desired width and height for your video to display in. You also have the option of using HTTP Streaming support, but you should not check this box unless you know what that is and if your server supports it.</div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;">If you are developing for commercial purpose or otherwise do not wish to use the Free JW Player, select the "Use HTML5 video support." If you want your content to play in all browsers, make sure to encode your video in BOTH MP4 and OGG video formats. </div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;">In either case, you may specify a "poster image", which is a sort of preview image that displays before the viewer selects to play the video.</div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;">For all video and image files, you may either type in a URL in the box, or click "Browse" and select a file on your computer. If the file is not within your EClass directory, it will be copied over for you.</div><div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
