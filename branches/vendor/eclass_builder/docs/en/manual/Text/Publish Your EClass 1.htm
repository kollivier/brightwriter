<html><head><base href="about:blank"></head><body>Once you have
finished creating and organizing your EClass, it is time to publish it.
To publish your EClass, you will need to have access to either a
CD-Recordable/Rewritable drive (for CD publishing), or have a web site
you can post the EClass to (for Internet publishing). We will cover the
steps for both methods below.<br>
<br>
<b>Publishing to CD-ROM</b><br>
From the main screen, either click on the <img src="../Graphics/cd16.gif"> button in the toolbar, or select <i>File-&gt;Publish-&gt;To CD-ROM</i>
from the main menu. EClass.Builder will now update the full-text index
(if you enabled searching) and prepare your EClass for CD-ROM
publishing. When that is finished, a folder will appear with all the
files that need to be burned to CD-ROM. You will need to either copy
and paste, or drag and drop, the files into your CD recording software.<br>
<br>
<b>Publishing to Internet/FTP<br>
<br>
</b>From the main screen, either click on the <img src="../Graphics/ftp_upload16.gif"> button, or select <i>File-&gt;Publish-&gt;To Web Site</i> from the main menu. A dialog will appear asking for some information. <br>
<br>
<div align="center"><img src="../Graphics/publish_web_site.jpg"><br>
<br>
<div align="left">Often, most of this information will be given to you
by either your network system administrator, or your internet service
provider. The <b>Host</b> is the name of the web site you would like to post your EClass to, <b>Username </b>and <b>Password </b>are your user account information, and <b>Directory </b>is the folder on the web site where you want your EClass to reside. <br>
<br>
The <b>Passive FTP</b> option is sometimes necessary to enable uploading to some
internet service providers. If you are experiencing problems uploading,
try selecting the Passive FTP option and trying again.<br>
<br> The dialog will show upload progress for each individual file as
well as for the entire upload process as a whole. Note that this may
take some time on slow internet connections.<br>
