settings dialog, you can customize how your EClass works. To access the
project settings dialog, from the main menu select <i>File-&gt;Project Settings</i>. The project settings dialog has four tabs: General, Search, Publish and FTP.<br>


<br>


<b>General Settings</b><br>

Currently, this tab stores the metadata for the project, including name, description and keywords.<br>


<br>


<b>Search Settings</b><br>

<br>


EClass.Builder is capable of creating full-text indexes for your EClass using either <a href="http://www.swish-e.org" target="_blank">SWISH-E</a> or <a href="http://www.greenstone.org" target="_blank">Greenstone</a>,
both open source full-text index software. SWISH-E is the default in
EClass. Select the "Enable Search Function" option to make your EClass
searchable. Note also that if you use Greenstone, you need to give it a
'publication id' of 8 characters or less, which you can specify in this
dialog.<br>


<br>


<b>Publish Settings</b><br>

<br>


There is a 'restrict filenames to 31 characters' option which enables Mac OS 9 users to view the EClass.<br>


<br>


<b>FTP Settings<br>

</b><br>
You can store your FTP settings, including your Passive FTP setting,
here. This information is automatically stored when you upload to FTP.
You can also choose to have files automatically uploaded when they are
saved using the "Upload Files on Save" option.<br>
