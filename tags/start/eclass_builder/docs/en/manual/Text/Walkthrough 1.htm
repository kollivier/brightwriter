<html><head><base href="about:blank"></head><body>In this tutorial,
we will step through the process of creating an EClass so that you can
see the steps involved. The basic outline of the EClass creation
process is as follows:<br>
<br>
<ol>
  <li><b>Create a New Project: </b>Name your project and (optionally) provide some simple metadata.</li>
  <li><b>Choose a Theme for Your Project:</b> Decide on a look and feel for your project using the theme manager.<br>
  </li>
  <li><b>Add/Edit Pages: </b>To do this, you can import files (for
example, Word, PDF, Flash) or you can use EClass' own plugin content
formats to create new files, such as a web page, quiz or EClass page.</li>
  <li><b>Publish your EClass:</b> Publish your EClass to CD-ROM or the Internet</li>
</ol>
